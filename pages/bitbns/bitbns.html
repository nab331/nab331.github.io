                    Naturally, the biggest pain point of any user starting investing or trading for the first time is “I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t want to lose my hard earned money”. 
                    The fundamental frustration of this group of users is lack of financial education. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/the-investopedia-affluent-millennials-study-4769751">Investopedia</a>  found out that 
                    <span class="quote">
                        <br>
                        Only 37% of affluent millennials feel knowledgeable about investing at all.
                        <br>
                        High-income millennials who feel knowledgeable about investing are 5X more likely (73% vs. 14%) to feel very confident in their ability to make their own financial decisions.

                    </span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The second frustration that is common to both the experienced trader and the beginner is “Can I trust this platform?” 
                    After the trust is established, the initial question of any consumer would be “Why bitbns? How is it better than the other platforms? How much does it cost to start”

                <div class="text">
                   Many trading applications targeted at beginners like IQoptions and Olymptrade capitalize on this frustration of the user. They promise step by step learning guides and ready made strategies that will help them become a profitable trader. They’ve run several marketing campaigns with million+ views on instagram based on this very idea validating that financial education is afterall the main pain point of the user.

                   1. Establish Bitbns as a legitimate trading platform (Showing the trades and currencies available) without intimidating the newer user.
                   <br>
                    2. Answer the broader questions that both users have before creating a free account. (Is it trustworthy?, How much will it cost me?, Customer Support)
                    <br>
                    3. Tackle the primary need of the beginner trader by offering classes and strategies (Rebranding existing youtube videos as bitbns academy)
                    <br>
                    4. Highlight other lesser known features of the platform (mainly targeted at the  experienced traders)
                    <br>
                    5. Establish social proof with user testimonials.
                    <br>
                    6. Final Call to Action.

                    Considering that users can still trade with a smaller amount without KYC verification and that newer traders have a lot of anxiety when it comes to any information intensive operations, it is crucial to note that :
