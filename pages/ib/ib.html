                    The main objective of my research phase was to answer the following questions : 
                    <ul>
                        <li>How do other companies/softwares tackle this problem?</li>
                        <li>What are the factors that need to be focussed on to improve the speed at which issues can be resolved?</li>
                        <li>What are the factors that need to be focused on to improve customer satisfaction?</li>
                        <li>What tools/techniques can I use to automate parts of this process, incorporate feedback for continual improvement and reduce the load on the operations team.</li>

                        <li>Softwares like ZenDesk use macros(pre-prepared responses) to respond quickly to customer requests</li>
                        <li>Softwares like Salesforce have auto response rules that allow for automatic responses to questions that fit a particular theme.</li>
                        <li>Sites like Google and LinkedIn give Auto-suggestions for messages and emails received, allowing for faster responses.â€™</li>

                        Categorization helps with making the pre-recorded response work better and also makes the process of identifying tasks that need to be reassigned much faster.

                        Auto-assigning issues as opposed to picking up issues one by one as auto assigning prioritizes speed. However, if one member is not available on a particular day, it may result in extra complexities to go to settings and deactivate the member for the day.

                         If a member is too occupied with a certain task and he can't finish it, he can un-assign it himself and the issue will be shifted to a member with the least amount of tasks.

                         Other decisions like not making the filters sticky have been made considering the frequency of use of such filters.
