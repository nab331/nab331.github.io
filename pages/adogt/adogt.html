                    Adogt is an app that facilitates adoption of shelter dogs. Initially, I saw this problem statement as a part of our college fest’s 24 hour product design competition. Intrigued, I decided to work on it on my own time.
                    <br/><br/> Before I started anything, I decided to find out the pain points of the dog adoption process and answer the following questions.
                    <br/><br/> What makes adopting a dog so difficult? Why do people prefer buying pets instead of adopting them? What makes a dog desirable for adopters? How does one find the right dog for themselves? Why do adopted dogs get returned?

                                     believed that shelter animals are less desirable than those purchased from breeders.
                                    In reality, not only are most shelter animals great family pets, but shelter animals tend to be healthier than those purchased at a pet store.

                        Since adopting a dog comes with a lot of questions and uncertainties, the user can ask the adoption center queries regarding the dog and its tendencies. Once his/her queries are answered, he/she may choose to visit the dog and see if the dog is as he/she
                        expected it to be.
                        <br><br> Once the user is satisfied with their option, they apply for adoption. The adoption policies of shelters are different in different locations. If the shelter is strict on their adoption policy, they can ask a lot of qualifying
                        questions like “Would you be able to take the dog for social classes once a week?” or questions about household, age, previous and current pets, the condition/size of the house and yard to see if the user is fit for the dog or
                        not.
                        <br><br> After that, the user signs an adoption agreement, pays the adoption fees, if such a fee exists and collects the dog.

                        This section dispels common myths that people have about shelter dogs such as "Shelter dogs are unhealthy" or "Shelter dogs are untrained".

                        <br><br> 6. After that, the user can either opt to visit the dog or have the shelter deliver the dog to their address.

                    <li><b>This project has made me realise the importance of data and research</b>
                    <br>Before doing the research, i thought that the most factors for successful adoption were the health, story, breed and training of the dog.
                     After the research phase I learn that factors like age, looks, size, behaviour and breed were a much more important factor for adoption success. </li>
                     <br>
                     <li><b>What I would have done differently:</b>
                         <br>I did not take into consideration factors outside the dogs physical and behaviour charecteristics for successful adoption
                         such as the importance of adoption fee for a successful adoption. Although the fees are insignificant, researching how much adoption fees affected successful adoption would have yielded a better adoption experience.
                        <br><br>The onboarding process is too lengthy. Looking back, I could have asked the user for the filter options and location after the Browsing page loaded.
